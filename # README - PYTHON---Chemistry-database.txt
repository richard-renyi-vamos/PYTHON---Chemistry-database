To create a simple chemistry database in Python, we can use SQLite (a lightweight SQL database) to store and manage chemical elements, compounds, or reactions. I'll walk you through setting up a basic database that could store elements and their properties.

Steps:
Set up the database structure: We'll create tables for elements and compounds.
Insert data: We'll add some initial elements and their properties (like atomic number, symbol, etc.).
Perform queries: You can retrieve information about elements and compounds using SQL queries.
Code Example:
First, you need to install sqlite3, which comes pre-installed with Python, so no extra packages are required.

1. Database Setup
python
Copy code
import sqlite3

# Connect to a database or create one if it doesn't exist
conn = sqlite3.connect('chemistry.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create tables for chemical elements and compounds
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS elements (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    atomic_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    atomic_weight REAL,
    group_number INTEGER
)
''')

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS compounds (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    formula TEXT NOT NULL,
    molecular_weight REAL,
    state_at_room_temp TEXT
)
''')

conn.commit()
2. Insert Data
We can insert some elements (for example, Hydrogen, Helium, and Oxygen):

python
Copy code
# Insert data for chemical elements
elements_data = [
    ('Hydrogen', 'H', 1, 1.008, 1),
    ('Helium', 'He', 2, 4.0026, 18),
    ('Oxygen', 'O', 8, 15.999, 16)
]

cursor.executemany('''
INSERT INTO elements (name, symbol, atomic_number, atomic_weight, group_number)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
''', elements_data)

# Insert data for compounds (for example, Water and Carbon Dioxide)
compounds_data = [
    ('Water', 'H2O', 18.01528, 'liquid'),
    ('Carbon Dioxide', 'CO2', 44.01, 'gas')
]

cursor.executemany('''
INSERT INTO compounds (name, formula, molecular_weight, state_at_room_temp)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
''', compounds_data)

conn.commit()
3. Query the Database
Now, you can write queries to retrieve information, such as all elements or specific details about a compound:

python
Copy code
# Query all elements
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM elements')
elements = cursor.fetchall()

print("Elements:")
for element in elements:
    print(element)

# Query compounds
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM compounds')
compounds = cursor.fetchall()

print("\nCompounds:")
for compound in compounds:
    print(compound)

# Example of querying a specific element (Oxygen)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM elements WHERE name = 'Oxygen'")
oxygen = cursor.fetchone()
print("\nDetails of Oxygen:")
print(oxygen)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
Output Example:
arduino
Copy code
Elements:
(1, 'Hydrogen', 'H', 1, 1.008, 1)
(2, 'Helium', 'He', 2, 4.0026, 18)
(3, 'Oxygen', 'O', 8, 15.999, 16)

Compounds:
(1, 'Water', 'H2O', 18.01528, 'liquid')
(2, 'Carbon Dioxide', 'CO2', 44.01, 'gas')

Details of Oxygen:
(3, 'Oxygen', 'O', 8, 15.999, 16)
Features you could expand on:
Add more chemical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points).
Store chemical reactions between elements or compounds.
Create relationships between elements and compounds using foreign keys.
